Quantrs is a tiny quantitative finance library for Rust.
It is designed to be as intuitive and easy to use as possible so that you can work with derivatives without the need to write complex code or have a PhD in reading quantlib documentation.
The library is still in the early stages of development, and many features are not yet implemented.

Please check out the documentation [here][docs-url].

## Features

### Options Pricing

For now quantrs only supports options pricing of vanilla and exotic options with continuous dividends yields.

The following models are available:

|                             | Black-Scholes   | Black-76 | Lattice      | ³Monte-Carlo  | Finite Diff   | Heston |

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
quantrs = "0.1.3"
```

Now if you want to e.g., model binary call options using the Black-Scholes model, you can:

```rust
use quantrs::options::*;

fn main() {
    // Create a new instrument with a spot price of 100 and a dividend yield of 2%
    let instrument = Instrument::new()
        .with_spot(100.0)
        .with_continuous_dividend_yield(0.02);

    // Create a new Cash-or-Nothing binary call option with a strike price of 85
    let option = BinaryOption::cash_or_nothing(instrument, 85.0, OptionType::Call);

    // Create a new Black-Scholes model with:
    // - Time to maturity (T) = 0.78 years
    // - Risk-free interest rate (r) = 5%
    // - Volatility (σ) = 20%
    let model = BlackScholesModel::new(0.78, 0.05, 0.2);

    // Calculate the price of the binary call option using the Black-Scholes model
    let price = model.price(&option);
    println!("Price: {}", price);

    // Calculate the Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho) for the option
    let greeks = OptionGreeks::calculate(&model, option);
    println!("Greeks: {:?}\n", greeks);
}
```

This will output:

```text
Price: 0.8006934914644723
Greeks: OptionGreeks { delta: 0.013645840354947947, gamma: -0.0008813766475726433, theta: 0.17537248302290848, vega: -1.3749475702133236, rho: 0.4398346243436515 }
```

See the [documentation][docs-url] for more information and examples.

## Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV)

This crate requires a Rust version of 1.65.0 or higher. Increases in MSRV will be considered a semver non-breaking API change and require a version increase (PATCH until 1.0.0, MINOR after 1.0.0).

## Outlook

See [OUTLOOK.md](OUTLOOK.md) for a list of planned features and improvements.
